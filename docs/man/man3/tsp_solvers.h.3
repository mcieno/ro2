\fIxopt\fP CPLEX incumbent solution\&.
.br
\fIproblem\fP Pointer to the instance structure

.PP
Given a CPLEX-generated solution, create a more convenient representation\&. Given the incumbent solution \fCxopt\fP, where \fCxopt[e] = 1 <==> edge e was selected\fP, populate provided arrays \fCnext\fP and \fCcomps\fP so that \fCnext[i] = j <==> the tour goes from node i to node j\fP and \fCcomps[i] = k <==> node i is part of the k-th subtour\fP\&.
.PP
The number of subtours is written to \fCncomps\fP, hence \fCxopt\fP is a valid TSP solution iff \fCncomps == 1\fP\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fIproblem\fP Pointer to the instance structure\&.
.br
\fIxopt\fP CPLEX incumbent solution\&. \fCxstar[xpos(i, j)] == 1\fP iff the edge was selected\&.
.br
\fInext\fP Array of adjacencies to be filled\&. \fCnext[i] = j\fP means that there is an arc going from node \fCi\fP to node \fCj\fP\&.
.br
\fIcomps\fP Array of components indices to be filled\&. \fCcomps[i] = k\fP means that node \fCi\fP belongs to connected component \fCk\fP\&.
.br
\fIncomps\fP Pointer to an integer where to store the number of connected components in the solution\&. If 1, the solution is a tour\&.
.br
\fIpos\fP Pointer to a function that given coordinates \fCi\fP and \fCj\fP returns the position in \fCxopt\fP fo \fCx(i,j)\fP\&.

.SS "void dummyBBf_model (\fBinstance\fP * problem)"

.PP
Solve with dummy 'Branch and Bound' model (variant 'F'), restarting cplex after every intermediate solution\&. This model is similar to \fBdummyBB_model()\fP\&. The main difference is that it starts with a loose EPGAP and tightens it iteration after iteration, until a single component is found, possibly sub-optimal\&. At that point, the default MIP optimizer is run\&.

.SS "void dummyBBm_model (\fBinstance\fP * problem)"

.PP
Solve with dummy 'Branch and Bound' model (variant 'M'), restarting cplex after every intermediate solution\&. This model is similar to \fBdummyBB_model()\fP\&. The main difference is that it starts with a loose EPGAP and a small limit of solutions\&. It tightens the gap and increases the solution limit until a single component is found, possibly sub-optimal\&. At that point, the default MIP optimizer is run\&.

.SS "void dummyBBx_model (\fBinstance\fP * problem)"

.PP
Solve with dummy 'Branch and Bound' model (variant 'X'), restarting cplex after every intermediate solution\&. This model is similar to \fBdummyBB_model()\fP\&. The main difference is that it starts with a tight EPGAP and a large limit of solutions\&. It looses them according to the number of components it found at each solution, until a single component is found, possibly sub-optimal\&. At that point, the default MIP optimizer is run\&.
